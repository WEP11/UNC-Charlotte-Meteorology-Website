	This is the UNC Charlotte Meteorology Program, Radar Room, providing plots for <b><i>ALL</i></b> radar products in the NC/VA/SC/GA region.<br><br>
	
	Product generation here is actually quite simple: selected data from our LDM is decoded and plotted via GEMPAK and converted into an animated gif image. It isn't the prettiest system, but it works. We have
	done our best here to provide all available WSR-88D and TDWR products from our region. Keep in mind that there are 21 products per TDWR site and 93 per WSR-88D site, totalling 921 plots to generate and account for.
	Thus mistakes were and will be made along the way. Let us know if there are missing products, mis-labeled products, or products that would be more useful if presented differently. To give feedback, suggestions, 
	or complaints on any of the services provided here, feel free to contact us.<br><br></p>
